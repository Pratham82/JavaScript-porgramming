// Basic Data Structures: Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data

/*
A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is known as a 
multi-dimensional array, or an array that contains other arrays.
*/

/*
We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning
an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array
should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.
*/

let yourArray; // Change this line
yourArray = ['test1',111,true,'w',45.5,undefined]

console.log(yourArray);
console.log(yourArray.length);
