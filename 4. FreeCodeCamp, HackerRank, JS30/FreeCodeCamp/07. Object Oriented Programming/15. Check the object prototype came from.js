// Object Oriented Programming: Understand Where an Object’s Prototype Comes From

/*
Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. 
*/

/*
Use isPrototypeOf to check the prototype of beagle.
*/

function Dog(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

// Only change code below this line
Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);

console.log(Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle));
