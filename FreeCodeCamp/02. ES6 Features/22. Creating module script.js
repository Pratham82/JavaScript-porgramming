// ES6: Create a Module Script

/*
ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. 
This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, 
and importing the parts you need where you need them.

In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script 
in your HTML document with a type of module.

*/

// Add a script to the HTML document of type module and give it the source file of index.js


`
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Only change code below this line -->
    <script type="module" src="index.js" ></script>
    <!-- Only change code above this line -->
  </body>
</html>
