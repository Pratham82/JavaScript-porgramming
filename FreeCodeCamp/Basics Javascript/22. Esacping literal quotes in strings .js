// Basic JavaScript: Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:


var myStr = ""; // Change this line

myStr =" I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"." // Change this line
console.log('myStr:', myStr)
